# Project Ideas 
* website to help students with their choosing of AP classes. 
We want to create a website that helps students decided what AP classes they want to take. It will display the different AP classes and have different information about the AP classes. The students can filter through the AP classes and take a quiz that will decided what AP classes might be best for them. 
## Sponsor
- Men's Vollyball 
   * website for men's volleyball sports team 

- Counselor?   
   * counselors will be able to give it to students in order to give them a basics to what AP classes to take or what each AP class is. 
Functions   
* database of AP Classes 
* reviews of AP classes 
* Search bar that filters by interest 
* quiz to decided what AP classes to take 

## PII concerns

- Are website will not display personal information of players or users. 
- There is not a lot of concerns, possible email or address exposure. 

## hosting plan

- We will use a rasberry pie to deploy
- Every thursday at 9pm we will make sure we push all of our stuff
- Afterwards, Vunsh will pull the code and deploy before Friday. 

## software license

- GPL-3.0 liscense is a public liscense so it can be viewed and used
- it is easy and understandable
- we can potentially gain revenue using this liscense
